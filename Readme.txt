These are 4 unity projects to generate maze. Each project builds a maze in a unique way. These can be used to make 3D environments (both static and dynamic)

1. Maze using Binary Tree Algorithm
This is the simplest of all the mazes. It has a lot of bias(In two sides) and it can be solved really easily.
Advantage - Computationally cheap

2. Maze using Sidewinder Algorithms
This is a bit complicated than Binary tree. It has a bias in one side. But if the player is made to start from the bias side to solve the maze, the maze is quite hard to solve.

3. Maze using Recursive Backtracking
It is quite complicated. But the best thing about the maze generated by recursive backtracking is that the maze is fair(no bias).
Also, it produces complicated mazes when maze size is large.

4. Maze using Recursive Masking
It is improvement on Maze made using Recursive Backtracker. It blocks some of the tiles(i.e. makes some of the maze area unaccessible
to the player.)
